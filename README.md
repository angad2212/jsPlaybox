# JavaScript Playbox

JS Playbox is a meticulously curated collection of 25 advanced JavaScript challenges, designed to sharpen both backend and frontend development skills. Each problem delves into fundamental concepts, with a strong emphasis on optimizing performance, mastering asynchronous workflows, and architecting scalable, high-performance web applications. Additionally, the set includes integration challenges that bridge backend functionality with frontend design, allowing for hands-on practice in building end-to-end solutions. This set is ideal for developers seeking to refine their technical prowess in real-world scenarios and stand out in competitive tech environments.

Here's a breakdown of the key areas covered:

Frontend:

DOM manipulation and event handling: Toggling elements, real-time filtering, form validation, modal popups, and interactive UI elements.
JavaScript core concepts: Variables, functions, objects, arrays, and loops.
Asynchronous programming: Using promises or async/await for asynchronous operations.
State management: Managing application state using local storage or other techniques.

Backend:

Node.js and Express: Creating web servers, defining routes, and handling HTTP requests.
API design and implementation: RESTful APIs with CRUD operations.
Data handling: Storing and retrieving data (in-memory for simplicity).
Authentication and authorization: Using JWT for secure authentication.
File handling: Uploading, downloading, and processing files.
Error handling: Implementing appropriate error handling and returning meaningful error messages.
Middleware: Using middleware for authentication, validation, and rate limiting.
